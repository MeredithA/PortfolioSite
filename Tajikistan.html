			<h2><u>History</u></h2>
				<a name="History"></a>
		</font>
			<ul class="bulletpointsheight">
				<li> Russian Imperialism led to the Russian Empire's conquest of Central Asia during the late 19th century's Imperial Era.</li>
			<br>
				<li>By 1885 Tajikistan's territory was either ruled by the Russian Empire or its vassal state, the Emirate of Bukhara, nevertheless Tajiks felt little Russian influence. Between 1927 and 1934, collectivisation of agriculture and a rapid expansion of cotton production took place, especially in the southern region.</li>
			<br>
				<li>Tajiks began to be conscripted into the Soviet Army in 1939 and during World War II around 260,000 Tajik citizens fought against Germany, Finland and Japan.</li>
			<br>
				<li>By the late 1980s Tajik nationalists were calling for increased rights. Real disturbances did not occur within the republic until 1990. The following year, the Soviet Union collapsed, and Tajikistan almost immediately fell into civil war.</li>
			<br>
				<li>The Civil War ended in 1997 and elections were held in 1999. Though they were highly criticised by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair. Russian border troops were stationed along the Tajik–Afghan border until summer 2005.</li>

			<h2><u>Geography</u></h2>
				<a name="Geography"></a>
		</font>
				<ul>
					<li>Tajikistan is landlocked, and is the smallest nation in Central Asia by area.</li>
			<br>
				 <li>It is covered by mountains of the Pamir range, and more than fifty percent of the country is over 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) above sea level.</li>
			<br>
				<li>Tajikistan consists of 4 administrative divisions.</il>

			<h2><u>Economy</u></h2>
				<a name="Economy"></a>
		</font>
			<ul>
				<li>Tajikistan's economy grew substantially after the war. The GDP of Tajikistan expanded at an average rate of 9.6% over the period of 2000–2007 according to the World Bank data.</li>
			<br>
				<li>Nearly 47% of Tajikistan's GDP comes from immigrant remittances (mostly from Tajiks working in Russian Federation). The current economic situation remains fragile, largely owing to corruption, uneven economic reforms, and economic mismanagement. With foreign revenue precariously dependent upon remittances from migrant workers overseas and exports of aluminium and cotton, the economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks.</li>
			<br>
				<li>The primary sources of income in Tajikistan are aluminium production, cotton growing and remittances from migrant workers.[59] Cotton accounts for 60% of agricultural output, supporting 75% of the rural population, and using 45% of irrigated arable land.</li>
			</ul>

	<h2><u>Demographics</u></h2>
		<ul> <line-height: 90%>
			<li>Tajikistan has a population of 8,734,951 (2016 est.)[3] of which 70% are under the age of 30 and 35% are between the ages of 14 and 30.[56] Tajiks who speak Tajik (a dialect of Persian) are the main ethnic group, although there are sizeable minorities of Uzbeks and Russians, whose numbers are declining due to emigration.</li>
		<br>
			<li>In 1989, ethnic Russians in Tajikistan made up 7.6% of the population, but they are now less than 0.5%, after the civil war spurred Russian emigration.</li>
		</ul>

			<h2><u>Culture</u></h2>
				<a name="Culture"></a>
		<ul>
			<li>The Tajik language is the mother tongue of around 80% of the citizens of Tajikistan. The official and vernacular language of Tajikistan is Tajik although Russian is routinely used in business and communication.</li>
		<br>
			<li>Tajikistan considers itself a secular state with a Constitution providing for freedom of religion. The Government has declared two Islamic holidays, Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, as state holidays. According to a US State Department release and Pew research group, the population of Tajikistan is 98% Muslim. Approximately 87%–95% of them are Sunni and roughly 3% are Shia and roughly 7% are non-denominational Muslims.[98][99] The remaining 2% of the population are followers of Russian Orthodoxy, Protestantism, Zoroastrianism and Buddhism.</li>
		<br>
			<li>The national sport of Tajikistan is gushtigiri, a form of traditional wrestling.</li>
		<br>
			<li>Another popular sport is buzkashi, a game played on horseback, like polo. One plays it on one's own and in teams. The aim of the game is to grab a 50 kg dead goat, ride clear of the other players, get back to the starting point and drop it in a designated circle.</li>
		<br>
			<li>Despite repeated efforts by the Tajik government to improve and expand health care, the system remains extremely underdeveloped and poor, with severe shortages of medical supplies</li>
		<br>
			<li>Public education in Tajikistan consists of 11 years of primary and secondary education but the government has plans to implement a 12-year system in 2016.</li>
